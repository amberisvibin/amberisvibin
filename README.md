### Hello!

 - I am a hobby programmer, trying to learn more about everything tech.
 - I am working on a few things, including a [Motorola 6809 based retrocomputer](https://github.com/amberisvibin/chibi-pc09).
 - My gists are available [here](https://gist.github.com/amberisvibin).
 - I am currently learning [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust).
 - I am on [dev.to](https://dev.to/amberisvibin).
 - You can contact me at amberisvibin@gmail.com.
 
 P.S. If I ever get my own site I'll probably host my own project there, and keep GitHub around for working on others' projects.
